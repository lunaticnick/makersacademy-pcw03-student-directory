# Student Directory #

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled
at Villains Academy

## How to use ##

Run "directory_final.rb" and follow the prompts/selections depending on what you
want to do.

## Future Improvements ##
The directory program works but we need to improve on the following aspects:

(1) When loading a file using an argument on CLI level, we get the prompt as if
we have selected option 4 and are loading names from file, so it asks for the
file name again. Maybe we need to create a new method just for this.

(2) Clear up any comments that are too self-explanatory
